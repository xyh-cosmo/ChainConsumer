=============
ChainConsumer
=============

ChainConsumer is a python package designed to do one thing - consume the chains
output from Monte Carlo processes like MCMC. ChainConsumer can utilise these chains
to produce plots of the posterior surface inferred from the chain distributions,
to plot the chains as walks (to check for mixing and convergence), and to output
parameter summaries in the form of LaTeX tables. On top of all of this,
if you have multiple models (chains), you can load them all in and perform some
model comparison using AIC, BIC or DIC metrics.

To get things started, here is a basic example:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from chainconsumer import ChainConsumer

    mean = [0.0, 4.0]
    data = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, [[1.0, 0.7], [0.7, 1.5]], size=100000)

    c = ChainConsumer()
    c.add_chain(data, parameters=["$x_1$", "$x_2$"])
    c.plotter.plot(filename="example.png", figsize="column", truth=mean)


The output figure is displayed below.

.. figure::     ../paper/example.png
   :align:     center
   :width:     80%

Installation
------------

ChainConsumer requires the following dependencies, along with a LaTeX installation and `dvipng` (a maptlotlib dependency):

.. literalinclude:: ../requirements.txt

ChainConsumer can be installed as follows::

    pip install chainconsumer

Common Issues
-------------

Users on some Linux platforms have reported issues rendering plots using ChainConsumer.
The common error states that `dvipng: not found`, and as per `StackOverflow <http://stackoverflow.com/a/32915992/3339667>`_
post, it can be solved by explicitly install the `matplotlib` dependency `dvipng` via `sudo apt-get install dvipng`.
