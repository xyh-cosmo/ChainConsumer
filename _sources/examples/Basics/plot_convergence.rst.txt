Convergence Diagnostics
=======================

How to use the built in convergence diagnostic tests!



Here we create some good and bad data, and then run convergence tests on it!



.. code-block:: python



    import numpy as np
    from numpy.random import normal
    from chainconsumer import ChainConsumer

    np.random.seed(0)
    # Here we have some nice data, and then some bad data,
    # where the last part of the chain has walked off, and the first part
    # of the chain isn't agreeing with anything else!
    data_good = normal(size=100000)
    data_bad = data_good.copy()
    data_bad += np.linspace(-0.5, 0.5, 100000)
    data_bad[98000:] += 2

    # Lets load it into ChainConsumer, and pretend 10 walks went into making the chain
    c = ChainConsumer()
    c.add_chain(data_good, walkers=10, name="good")
    c.add_chain(data_bad, walkers=10, name="bad")

    # Now, lets check our convergence using the Gelman-Rubin statistic
    gelman_rubin_converged = c.diagnostic.gelman_rubin()
    # And also using the Geweke metric
    geweke_converged = c.diagnostic.geweke()

    # Lets just output the results too
    print(gelman_rubin_converged, geweke_converged)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    Gelman-Rubin Statistic values for chain good
    Param 0: 1.00003 (Passed)
    Gelman-Rubin Statistic values for chain bad
    Param 0: 1.07654 (Failed)
    Gweke Statistic for chain good has p-value 3.428820e-01
    Gweke Statistic for chain bad has p-value 2.290803e-06
    False False


We can see that both the Gelman-Rubin and Geweke statistics failed.
Note that by not specifying a chain when calling the diagnostics,
they are invoked on *all* chains. For example, to invoke the statistic
on only the second chain we can pass in either the chain index, or the chain
name:



.. code-block:: python


    print(c.diagnostic.geweke(chain="bad"))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    Gweke Statistic for chain bad has p-value 2.290803e-06
    False


Finally, note that the statistics are set to fail easily. For example,
if you have 10 chains and run `diagnostic_gelman_rubin` with the defaults,
you will get false if *any* parameter of *any* chain has not converged.
The printed output will let you know which chains and parameters are
culpable.
