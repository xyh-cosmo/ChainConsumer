================
Dividing a chain
================

ChainConsumer can split one chain into many!

If you use a sampling algorithm with multiple walkers (which
is fairly common), it can be useful to plot each walker as a separate chain
so that you can verify that your walkers have all converged to the same place.

You can use the `plot_walks` method for this, or the convergence diagnostics,
but the more options the better!

In the below example, I assume the generated data was created using ten walkers.
I introduce some fake shift in the data to badly emulate walker drift.
