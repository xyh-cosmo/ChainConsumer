========================
Gaussian KDE and Extents
========================

Smooth marginalised distributions with a Gaussian KDE, and pick custom extents.


Note that invoking the KDE on large data sets will significantly increase rendering time when
you have a large number of points. You can also pass a float to your KDE to modify the width
of the bandpass by that factor!

You can see the increase in contour smoothness (without broadening) for when you have a
low number of samples in your chains!
